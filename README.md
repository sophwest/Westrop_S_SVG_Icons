# Pokeball Icon Marketplace

Welcome to Pokemart! What if you could Pokeballs...online...and they're actually just SVG icons that do a little animation? Now you can, on this page where I am learning and practicing Javascript for the first time.  
Disclaimer: You can't actually buy Pokeballs through my page. I am a student, I don't know how to run a business.  

## Usage

Sorry I asked my mom but she said you can't :(

## History

***01/18/2023*** - Made a couple Pokeball SVG's in Illustrator  
***01/19/2023*** - Finished SVG's  
***01/20/2023*** - Optimized SVG's and created repo.  
***01/20/2023*** - Cried because my ai file got corrupted and I lost my optimized svg's! Put in placeholder image for the time being.  
***01/21/2023*** - Re-did SVG's! Added optimized SVG's to the images. Wrestled with CSS grid for like 6 hours and gave up on that and took the grid out.  
***01/21/2023*** - Styled to the best of my ability before just moving on to Javascript. Added Javascript.  
***01/23/2023*** - Got an extra life!  Went back to tackle the grid again with fresh eyes and styled everything WAY better.
***01/23/2023*** - Did all the animations using CSS and manipulated the SVG's to have an element change colour. All done!

## ANTI-Credits  

My external hard drive for corrupting my SVG's. Corrupt my files once, shame on you. Corrupt my files twice, shame on me and you're being exiled to the forgotten tech drawer.
