# Pokeball Icon Marketplace

Welcome to Pokemart! What if you could Pokeballs...online...and they're actually just SVG icons that do a little animation? Now you can, on this page where I am learning and practicing Javascript for the first time.  
Disclaimer: You can't actually buy Pokeballs through my page. I am a student, I don't know how to run a business.  

## Usage

Sorry I asked my mom but she said you can't :(

## History

***01/18/2023*** - Made a couple Pokeball SVG's in Illustrator  
***01/19/2023*** - Finished SVG's  
***01/20/2023*** - Optimized SVG's and created repo.  
***01/20/2023*** - Cried because my ai file got corrupted and I lost my optimized svg's! Put in placeholder image for the time being.  
***01/21/2023*** - Re-did SVG's! Added optimized SVG's to the images. Wrestled with CSS grid for like 6 hours and gave up on that and took the grid out.  
***01/21/2023*** - Styled to the best of my ability before just moving on to Javascript. Added Javascript.  
***01/23/2023*** - Got an extra life!  Went back to tackle the grid again and styled everything WAY better. Needed fresh eyes!
